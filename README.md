# pattern-image-analysis

Python code from a forthcoming publication on spontaneous pattern formation in organic semiconductors. This code allows one to extract periodic pattern wavelength from microscopy images using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), and to assess pattern quality based on the magnitude of the low frequency portion of the FFT. Much more sophisticated packages exist for this sort of analysis (e.g. [PyFAI](https://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), but these notebooks are shared to provide an example for how to analyze large image sets with relative ease.

Limited example images are included to illustrate the analysis functions. Most of the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebooks will not run, due to unavailable images. If you would like the full image sets, please contact me @jsbangsund.
